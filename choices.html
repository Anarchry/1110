<h1>Technology Choices</h1>

 <p align="justify">  There will be different job specifications in becoming cybersecurity that they can choose. According to Tokar (2020) cybersecurity can became an application security, data loss prevention, forensic, incident response, network security, security architecture, and threat intelligence.</p>
 <p align="justify"> 
 <ul>
<li>Application security according to Strom (2020) is, “[a]pplication security is the process of making apps more secure by finding, fixing, and enhancing the security of apps. Much of this happens during the development phase, but it includes tools and methods to protect apps once they are deployed”. </li><br>
<li>Data loss prevention or known as (DLP) according to proofpoint (n.d.) is to “makes sure that users do not send sensitive or critical information outside the corporate network. The term describes software products that help a network administrator control the data that users can transfer. DLP products use business rules to classify and protect confidential and critical information so that unauthorized users cannot accidentally or maliciously share data, which would put the organization at risk”.</li><br>

<li>Forensic or Analysts in computer forensics help in the criminal investigations and cybercrime incidents. In many cases, they work to recover additional data that has been hidden, encrypted, or deleted in connection with the case. They also protect data integrity by adhering to a chain of custody that ensures its permissibility in court.</li><br>

<li>Incident response according to Chai (n.d.)  “is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack, also known as an IT incident, computer incident or security incident. The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs”.</li><br>

<li>Network security according to Fruhlinger (2018) is “the process of taking physical and software preventative measures to protect the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, modification, destruction, or improper disclosure, thereby creating a secure platform for computers, users, and programs to perform their permitted critical functions within a secure environment”.</li><br>

<li>Security architecture according to RSI Security (2020) is  “a framework that specifies the organizational structure, standards, policies and functional behavior of a computer network, including both security and network features. Cybersecurity architecture is also the manner in which various components of your cyber or computer system are organized, synced and integrated”.</li><br>
<li>Threat intelligence according to EC-Council (n.d.)  “is the knowledge that allows you to prevent or mitigate cyber-attacks by studying the threat data and provide information on adversaries. It helps to identify, prepare, and prevent attacks by providing information on attackers, their motive, and capabilities”.</li></ul>
