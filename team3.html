<p align="justify">Our topic is cybersecurity. With the development of science and technology, computer networks have played an important role in people's study, education, work and life, and people are increasingly relying on the network. With the development of computer technology, the problem of cybersecurity technology has become increasingly prominent. Malicious attacks by hackers, the wanton spread of viruses, and the frequent occurrence of network violations have caused frequent troubles and troubles in people's lives.</p>

<p align="justify">I am very interested in this topic because I used to have my software password stolen by others just because I did not use a strong password, and it took a lot of time and energy to retrieve the password. Since then, I understand the importance of understanding the basics of cybersecurity.</p>

<p align="justify">In the process of cooperation, the team members get along happily. Firstly, group cooperation needs to have a clear division of labour within the group, reflect each person's strengths, make up for their shortcomings, and maximize the benefits of group cooperation. Secondly, team members need to communicate face-to-face when working together, which can promote every member's divergent thinking and optimize the results of cooperation. Also, communication between groups can improve the establishment of the team and personal responsibility and promote personal development. Therefore, we need to master the skills of teamwork. For example, in teamwork, establish an effective communication mechanism, formulate a reasonable time plan, assign individual task lists, help each other, and maximize cooperation.</p>

<p align="justify">I hope everyone needs to understand the basic cybersecurity knowledge and avoid unnecessary losses.</p>
