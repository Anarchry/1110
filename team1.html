<p align="justify">With the development of the times, more and more people choose to use the Internet. In many cases, network security is not taken seriously, and our lives cannot be guaranteed. We will enter our personal information on the Internet, ranging from social software to bank accounts. These are vital information for everyone. The account password will be saved to the website with permission, and the company's data will be stored in the cloud. If you check it irregularly, it may result in the loss of personal information, and problems with company funds or important information. When I finish studying this topic, I will begin to pay attention to this issue. I will be careful when there are hints that the website will leak personal information, and I will not go to some websites that are not approved by security. Many people may not have noticed the seriousness of the problem and feel that the chance of personal information exposure is small. In fact, this is not the case. I think people should slowly start to understand and begin to learn how to ensure and maintain network security. Perhaps more teaching will help individuals and companies.</p>
