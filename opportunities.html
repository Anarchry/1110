<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

<p align="justify">Before using a complete productivity software and data storage ecosystem, many people would choose to use a firewall to protect computer data. It is difficult to define network boundaries nowadays, because in many cases, companies and school computers will be hosted remotely by a third party. Through a wider range of devices, such as unmanaged bring your own device (BYOD), the user's personal device. Today, network boundaries have changed, including devices accessed inside and outside the group network, as well as managed and unmanaged devices. Many technologies have been upgraded or changed with the changes of the times, and many devices are no longer directly under the jurisdiction. Therefore, we are increasingly relying on and trusting third parties to maintain data security. Therefore, there will be many people who need to check the internal and external traffic of the firewall and peripheral devices; implement the security standards of the wireless network; perform necessary network isolation; view the supervision of all remote devices on the firewall and the server; update and check regularly The latest system of security and firmware; to ensure that the threat protection mechanism is up to date; regular vulnerability checks, etc. In order to ensure whether there are any weaknesses in the boundary between user equipment and network data, a technical and operational security assessment is required. Evaluation should focus on the effectiveness of systems, services and users in responding to internal/external technical or organizational attacks. Assessing risks can ensure that user information is guaranteed, and companies can also implement recommended security controls and mitigation measures in a structured manner. Now more and more information can be stolen from the Internet, such as information on social media accounts, Internet users, bank accounts and emails. These usually become the main targets of hackers, who obtain data without permission for personal gain or cause losses to others. In many cases, they will guess the password based on the existing information of the account. It is easy for many people to set the password, which also facilitates hacker attacks. In many cases, brute force is also used to explore user information. At this time, personal information should be protected from being stolen. And be careful when connecting your computer to an insecure network (such as free WiFi or Internet cafes). This channel is unstable and will be more intrusive. If something goes wrong, saving and transferring important data may be a top priority. Back up the data to an external hard drive, and then remove the hard drive from the device.</p>

<p align="justify">Protecting your network from cyberattacks is a long-term thing. In many cases, individual vulnerabilities will be discovered. Users should not only solve these problems one by one, but also establish a strong protection network to resist. All attacks. Company leaders should have sufficient awareness of network security to allow employees to implement the protection of the network. Because having an effective plan will not only allow the organization to reduce data leakage, but also make the overall operation smoother. Second, the threats faced by the company may also come from phishing and ransomware, which are all exploited by human error. A study from Privatise Business VPN suggests that staff aren't getting the training they need, with 53% of IT managers saying that employees need a greater understanding of cyber threats. Cyber security training can not only prevent data leakage, but also greatly improve the company The overall staff's understanding of cyber security. Risk assessment is one of the first tasks an organization should complete when preparing its cyber security plan. The best way to conduct a risk assessment is by following the guidelines outlined in the international standard for information security management, ISO 27001. Its best practice methods are built around the risk assessment process to help organizations understand threats and solutions related to people, processes, and technology. By writing policies and procedures, organizations can ensure that employees understand their safety obligations and consolidate the courses taught during employee awareness training. A more technically conscious strategy also provides the necessary help for the security solutions provided by IT. In many cases, companies can also physically isolate important data on the network, and can also play a role in protecting company data.</p>

<p align="justify">As far as network security is concerned, the lack of support from stakeholders will bring new risks. If there are no stakeholders, your organization’s information security plan may fail before it starts. Violations not only affect the company’s IT staff. According to the 2020 data breach cost report of IBM and Ponemon, the global average cost of a data breach is $3.86 million. In the event of violations, every department in the organization will be affected by financial costs, loss of customer trust and potential loss of new business, which has a very large impact on a company. Each organization's network security needs will be different. According to the maturity of the company's security status, the company's employees can raise technical issues, and even seek the guidance and help of security experts. As a leader of the company, you should continue to pursue this aspect and understand the scope of cybersecurity work. Communicate regularly with employees to ensure that they stay informed for a long time. The number of intrusion attempts and security incidents; the cost of detecting, controlling, and recovering from each incident; the number of patches implemented and the patch rate; the average detection time (MTTD); the average containment time (MTTC); the number of identified vulnerabilities, tracking and Reporting these indicators will give you a more comprehensive understanding of your cybersecurity practices and provide guidance for stakeholders on the actions that need to be taken to improve your security status. Coordination of business plans and cybersecurity work is the key to successfully preventing security incidents. If you don’t stay consistent, the company runs the risk of misunderstanding key plans and interruptions between organizational teams.</p>

<p align="justify">Protecting the physical and logical boundaries between data, software, and services and the outside world is critical. This is one of many areas in a multi-level data security approach. With the help of a third party, to protect data, whether on-premises or in the cloud.</p>
