<p align="justify">  Confidentiality would be a critical ethical issue in cybersecurity. Because of the nature of the work environment, security teams will contact and handle personal, private, or proprietary information that should be kept strictly confidential. Workers within those areas may be motivated to spill whatever fascinating information they uncovered when performing a virus check on somebody's hard drive, but doing so could harm that person's job or personal life. In a complicated connection, privacy concerns are linked with cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity is designed to protect us from threats like ransomware and identity theft, two types of hacking that rely on exposing a user's personal information. Furthermore, organizations with private customer data have an ethical obligation to keep that information safe from hackers. Unfortunately, the firms that were attacked were at least somewhat to blame in many high-profile data breaches.</p>
