<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>

<p align="justify">  Humanity has developed the use of technology for their daily life. Throughout the records, technologies have become a method to controls society. However, because of this innovation, many people fall victim to a cyberattack. Therefore, the terms "cybersecurity" is needed to keep the data safe.</p>

<p align="justify">  Essentially, the use of cybersecurity in the internet is used to protect the data from being stolen by the thievery. As Craigen, Daikun-Thibault, and Purse (2014) said that "Cybersecurity is the organization and collection of resources, processes, and structures used to protect cyberspace and cyberspace-enabled systems from occurrences that misalign de jure from de facto property rights. This is a serious issue about how cybercrimes are influencing across every possible aspect to remain one step ahead of technological development.</p>
