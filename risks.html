<h1>Cybersecurity Risks</h1>

<p align="justify">In recent years, cyber security has gradually developed into one of the prominent issues in the Internet field, and leaks caused by network security are on the rise globally. News about cyber-attacks and data breaches is also becoming more frequent. Attackers can be described as ubiquitous. The outside of the company is full of hackers, organized criminal groups, and nation-state cyber espionage. Their capabilities and arrogance are increasing day by day; inside the company are employees and contractors, whether they want to or not. May be the culprit for malicious or accidental incidents.</p>

<p align="justify">A survey results show that more than 90% of companies rely entirely or highly on the Internet to conduct business, but more than 45% of companies have had information security incidents of varying magnitude in the past three years. Large enterprises with a scale of more than 500 people and the telecommunications industry are the "severe disaster areas." More than 57% and 64% of enterprises have had related accidents, respectively. The accidents directly refer to the core information assets of enterprises and institutions such as commercial secrets and user information.</p> 
<p>In this article,I will discuss some common types of cybersecurity risks.</p>

<p><h3>Malware:</p></h3>
<p align="justify">Malware is the most common security threat, and its problems have existed since the birth of the Internet. According to Eric Dosal(2020), The way the malware works is to install software that the user does not need on the system to make the target system run abnormally. Abnormal operations include programs, deleting files, stealing information, and spreading itself to other systems.</p>

<p align="justify">Prevention method: Users should take the initiative to download and install the latest anti-malware software. Be cautious of suspicious links, files, and websites. For example,Ransomware, Trojans, Worms. </p>

<p><h3>Password Theft</p></h3>
<p align="justify">When a user logs in to a software account but finds that his password has been changed and lost, this is password theft. Whether it is an individual or a company, the password may be stolen. For companies that may lose sensitive data, the situation is much worse. Hackers can access your computer network without a security plan and manipulate your personal data, customer information, business intelligence, and many others.</p>

<p align="justify">Prevention: Use strong passwords and change them frequently, use the latest browsers that support encryption, and do not disclose personal information too much on social networking sites</p>

<p><h3>Software Defects</p></h3>
<p align="justify">Defects are defined as deviations between the actual and expected results of a system or software application. Software defects are because the developers (programmers) made some mistakes while developing the software. Common types of defects in the development process: 1. Arithmetic defects. 2. Logical defects.</p>

<p align="justify">Prevention: When the company releases software and develops a website, it needs to test the software website many times to avoid errors</p>
<p><h3>Phishing Attacks</p></h3>
<p align="justify">According to Eric Dosal(2020), The attacker tries to let company employees leak some companyâ€™s sensitive data, or let employees download malware. This is a phishing attack.</p>
<p align="justify">Prevention: 1.Check the email for viruses several times 2.Train employees to understand phishing knowledge</p>
